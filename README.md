# Clean Latex CV Template

MANY THANK TO Saikat Roy for contriuting in this project

Roy's Github repositorw : https://github.com/saikat-roy

A LaTeX template for a clean CV. Suitable for (but not restricted to) new grads or academics with some work experience.

Built with [Overleaf custom class guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/How_to_write_a_LaTeX_class_file_and_design_your_own_CV_(Part_1)) as a baseline and edited heavily.

Feel free to edit the class file in whatever way you deem fit to get your perfect variant of this layout. Or use it as a skeleton to build your own.
